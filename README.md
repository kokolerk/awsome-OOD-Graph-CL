This repository contains the paper list of 3 fields: **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Generalization, Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Generalization for graph and contrastive learning**. Although these three fields are distinct, they can potentially intersect with each other from the perspective of feature analysis, i.e. *dimensional collapse*, *neural collapse*, *singuler values distribution*.


We will try our best to make this paper list updated. If you notice some related papers missing, do not hesitate to contact us via pull requests at our repo.
